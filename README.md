## Features

- üî® **Bonk** anybody or anything with the power of command-line tools!
- üî¢ **Track** bonking statistics persistently in the cloud
- üñºÔ∏è **Display** delightful ASCII art with each successful BONK
- üåê **Cloud-based** bonking memory powered by *counterapi.dev*

## Installation

You need Go 1.18 or higher installed on your system.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KingJorjai/BONK.git
cd BONK

# Install the project
go install
```

## Usage

Bonking is as simple as pointing and... well, bonking!

```bash
# Basic usage
BONK <name>

# Examples
BONK keyboard
BONK mondayMornings
BONK bugs
```

### Example Output

```
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢Ä‚£Å‚£§‚£∂‚£∂‚°í‚†í‚†≤‚†æ‚£≠‚°Ü‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
...ASCII art...

You gave bugs a mighty BONK!
bugs has been bonked 42 times! BONK BONK!
```

## Rules of Bonking

1. Names must be 1-100 characters long
2. Only alphanumeric characters are allowed
3. No spaces or special characters (we're strict bonkers here!)
4. You can't bonk the void (empty names are not allowed)

## Advanced Bonking Techniques

For true bonking connoisseurs, try these pro moves:

```bash
# Bonk scheduled tasks
0 9 * * * BONK mondayMornings

# Count how many times you've bonked something
BONK coffee > /dev/null && echo "I need more coffee!"

# Multi-bonking with a for loop
for i in {1..5}; do BONK keyboard; done
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My BONK was denied!**  
A: Make sure you're using only letters and numbers, no spaces or special characters.

**Q: The API isn't responding!**  
A: The bonking servers might be overloaded with bonk requests. Please try again later.
